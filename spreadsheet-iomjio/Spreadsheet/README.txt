1. Comments to Evaluators:
I really don't how long it will cost me to finish this, I have never use C# nor VS before, so I believe this has to take 5+ hours.
In the end it did took something like 7h, and this is exluding the time I editing my code while listening to the lecture or in lab.
However I spend most of the time messing around with VS setup and redoing my code after read the instruction carefully.
I believe it wouldn't take more than 2h if I read all instructions and understood everything.
After I thought I have done with all my coding, I messed around with commiting and submitting for 5 hours at least, which made my assignment totally overdue.

I deleted everything and override them on again and again, I hope this is the last time I update this TXT.
 

2. Assignment Specific Topics
And I need to state that I have completed my coding before the dead line with enough of time that I believe will be enough to deal with submission issues, but apparently it is taking seemingly forever.
I admit this is totally because of I am a last minute person, but please be more specific of what the correct directory to store my work to make my life a little bit easier. Thanks.
And I think a certain folder in my Git is corrupted, its name is blackened and I can't open or delete it, plus the previous commiting madness cause my repository became a mass, so I created a new git account.
